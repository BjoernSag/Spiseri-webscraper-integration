Statement of Fact

Certificate Number: 0001426524

Country of Residence Selected: Norway

This Document provides the answers which you gave in the process of applying for and purchasing your Voyager Plus
Travel insurance and which form the basis upon which your premium was quoted with the policy terms and
conditions offered. You should check these carefully to ensure they are correct and contact us immediately if they
need to be changed.

Please ensure you have taken reasonable care to answer all the questions honestly and to the best of
your knowledge. If you don’t, your policy may be cancelled, or treated as if it never existed, or your
claim rejected or not fully paid.

If your answers to these questions change during the period of the insurance it is a general condition of this policy
that you advise us by contacting Voyager Healthcheck on 01483 806 666 for medical queries and Voyager Insurance
Services Ltd. on 01483 806 680 for all other queries as soon as possible so that we may reassess your coverage
relating to any trips you have booked or may wish to book in the future.
 

QUESTION

YOUR ANSWER

Please consider questions 1-5 & 7 very carefully in relation to yourself and your
travelling companions insured under this policy. Question 6 relates to non
travellers and travelling companions not insured by us. 
1. Do any of the statements below apply to you or your travelling companions?:

i.  have you/they been given a terminal diagnosis?
ii.  are you/they planning to travel against the advice of a Medical

Practitioner or travelling specifically to seek, or you/they know you will
need, medical treatment while you/they are away?

iii.  are you/they aware of the need for an operation or course of treatment

at a hospital or specialist clinic.

iv.  do you/they have any undiagnosed symptoms that require tests or

investigation or are you awaiting the results of any tests or
investigations?

 
2. Do you or your travelling companion(s) wish to apply for cover for your/their

current or pre-existing medical condition(s)?

Examples include (but are not limited to): diabetes, high blood pressure,
depression, heart, circulatory and respiratory conditions (including asthma)?

If you select No: you and your travelling companion(s) will have no cover for
any claim directly or indirectly relating to your/their current pre-existing
medical condition(s). Please proceed to question 6.

If you select Yes: to apply for cover and ensure you/they have the right cover
it is important you/they tell us about your/their medical history and that all
current pre-existing medical conditions are declared fully, accurately and
truthfully to the best of your/their knowledge.

Failure to do so could invalidate your/their policy and may result in part or all
of a claim not being paid.

 
3. Within the last 24 months, have you or your travelling companion(s) suffered
from, been investigated for, diagnosed with, received treatment or taken any
medication for;

a.  any cancer or malignant condition.
b.  any lung related condition (other than stable, well controlled asthma

that requires not more than 2 medications, including inhalers).

c.  any heart related condition (including angina)?

No 

No 

No 

 

NB – You/they must contact Voyager Healthcheck if you/they have taken any
medication or have had any surgical procedures for any of these conditions in
the past 24 months.
 
4. Do you or your travelling companion(s) currently suffer from or have suffered
from any medical condition that has required referral to or consultation with a
specialist clinic or hospital for treatment, tests or investigation within the 24
months prior to the date this insurance was arranged or the date that
you/they subsequently made arrangements for a trip?

NB – Continuing regular medication that is taken at home for a stable, well-
controlled condition does not amount to ‘treatment’ in this context and so does
not need to be screened.

If you or your travelling companion(s) have stable conditions that each require
no more than 2 routine check-ups/ reviews per year with a specialist clinic or
your/their usual medical practitioner then you/they do not need to be screened.
 
5. Has your doctor or your travelling companion(s) doctor changed or

commenced any regular prescribed medication in the last 3 months?

 
6. Are you aware of any pre-existing medical conditions suffered by non-

travellers or travelling companion(s) not insured by us whose state of health
is likely to cause you to cancel or amend your travel plans?

 
7. Are you planning to take part in any hazardous activities (see General

Exclusions 12-16 on page 18)?

If so, please contact Voyager Insurance Services on 01483 806 680 to see what
cover may be available.

Please Note: If during your application you have answered No to "Important Conditions and Questions Relating
to Health and Activities" Question 2 and therefore opted not to apply to cover Pre-Existing Medical
Conditions, you have no cover for any claim directly or indirectly related to your Pre-Existing Medical
Condition(s), in accordance with the policy terms, conditions and exclusions (irrespective of if they could have
been covered had you chosen to answer Yes to apply for and declare such Pre-Existing Medical Condition(s) and
they could have been subsequently covered).

There is also no cover under this policy for claims related directly or indirectly to these conditions if you have
answered Yes to any of the Questions 1 and 3 - 8, unless agreed by Us in writing and noted on your certificate.
Please refer to General Conditions 1,2 & 3 in your Policy Wording.

Voyager Insurance Services Ltd. - Terms of General Insurance Business - Website

Sales

Your attention is drawn to the following notes relating to the insurance you have arranged, or wish to

arrange with us.

Who We Are

Voyager Insurance Services Ltd is an independent insurance intermediary and acts on your behalf in
arranging your insurance. We are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Our
register number is 305814. We are permitted to arrange, advise on, deal as an agent of insurers and
clients and assist in claims handling with respect to noninvestment insurance policies. You can check
these details on the Financial Services Register by visiting the FCA’s website, www.fca.org.uk/register, or
by contacting the Financial Conduct Authority on 0800 111 6768.

Explanation of Service

Our service includes providing you with information relating to the cover we can arrange, arranging your
insurance cover with insurers to meet your requirements, and helping you with any ongoing changes you
have to make. As part of our service, we can also assist you with any claim you need to make.
In arranging this web-based insurance we deal with a single panel of insurers, details of these are shown
in the policy wording.
We do not provide any advice or recommendation concerning the insurance that you are arranging. The
site includes information and certain questions to narrow down the selection of products available to you,
from which you can then make your own choice.

Your Duty to Give Information to Insurers

Your insurance is based upon the information you provide to the insurers when arranging or renewing the
insurance or making any mid-term changes. You must ensure that all such information given is complete
and accurate. Please take care to answer all questions honestly and to the best of your knowledge.
You are responsible for all answers or statements that you make when arranging the insurance, on
proposal forms, statements of fact, claim forms or other material documents and you should ensure these
are full and accurate.
If you do not answer the questions correctly at the start of the policy or fail to advise the insurers
promptly of changes to the information you have given during the period of insurance, this may invalidate
your insurance cover and could mean that part, or all, of a claim may not be paid.

Confidentiality

All personal information about you will be treated as private and confidential (even when you are no
longer a customer), except where the disclosure is made at your request, with your consent, in relation to
arranging your insurance or where we are required to by law.
Some or all of the information you supply to us in connection with your insurance proposal will be held on
computer and may be passed to insurance and/or other companies for underwriting and claims purposes.
Under current Data Protection Act legislation you have a right of access to see personal information about
you that is held in our records, whether electronically or manually. If you have any queries, please write
to the Data Protection Officer at Voyager Insurance Services Ltd., 13-21 High Street, Guildford, Surrey
GU1 3DG.
For more information please refer to our Privacy Notice at www.voyagerinsurance.com/privacy/

How to claim

Please refer to your policy wording if you need to make a claim. You should contact the specified claims
handlers as soon as possible. If in any doubt about whom to contact, please telephone us on 01483 806
680.

Fees and Charges

Alterations & Cancellations - An administration fee of £15 may be charged for any alteration or for any
cancellation of a policy outside the initial 14 day ‘cooling off’ period.

Protecting your money

Prior to your premium being forwarded to the insurers, and for your protection, we hold premiums and
claims monies received as agent of your insurer and your policy is treated as having been paid for once
you have paid us.

Complaints

It is our intention to provide a high level of service at all times. If, however, you have reason to make a
complaint about our service, we have internal procedures for handling complaints fairly and promptly. In
the first instance you should contact the Managing Director at Voyager Insurance Services Ltd, 13-21,
High Street, Guildford, Surrey GU1 3DG or telephone 01483 806 680.

Our procedure is that:

Your complaint will be acknowledged within 5 business days.
Wherever possible, your complaint will be dealt with within 20 business days and if compensation or
redress is felt to be appropriate details of this will be provided. If it is felt that your complaint is not
justified you will be provided with full reasons for this decision.
If it is not possible to respond to your complaint within 20 business days you will be advised of the
reasons in writing and given a note of when you may expect a final response.
If you remain dissatisfied, you may be entitled to refer the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
We shall provide you with details upon request. Further information is available at www.financial-
ombudsman.org.uk or telephone 0800 023 4567.
If you do decide to refer any matters to the Financial Ombudsman Service your legal rights will not be

affected.
Alternatively, in respect of online sales only The European Commission has set up an online platform
where consumers in all EU Countries can register a complaint. This can only be made for complaints about
purchases made online

The Online Dispute Register (ODR) directs your enquiry to our complaints procedure, where it will be
handled in the usual way. It will also let you know that the Financial Ombudsmans Service (FOS) is the
UK's dispute resolution body for insurance. Should you need to escalate your complaint further, ODR will
ransmit your complaint to the FOS after 30 days.

Please note that this new EU service facilitates contact only it does not provide any other complaints
service. You can find this platform at http://ec.europa.eu/odr

Compensation Arrangements

We are members of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. You may be entitled to compensation
from the scheme if we are unable to meet our obligations. This depends on the type of business and the
circumstances of the claim. Further information about the compensation scheme is available at
www.fscs.org.uk or telephone 0800 678 1100 or 020 7741 4100.

Meeting your Demands and Needs for Insurance

The policy coverage provided is typical of the great majority of this type of insurance and is designed to
meet the needs of the customer when considering the risks associated with their plans. This website has
been designed to provide you with enough information for you to decide whether this policy meets your
particular demands and needs but we have not given you any specific or personal recommendation to buy
this insurance.
